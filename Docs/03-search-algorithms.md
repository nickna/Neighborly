# Search Algorithms in Neighborly

## Overview

Neighborly offers a comprehensive suite of search algorithms optimized for different use cases, data characteristics, and performance requirements. Each algorithm has specific strengths and is designed for particular scenarios.

## Search Types

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Find the k closest vectors to a query vector based on a specified distance metric.

**Use Cases:**
- Recommendation systems
- Content similarity
- Classification tasks
- Clustering validation

**Implementation:** Exact search using various spatial data structures.

### Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
Quickly find approximate nearest neighbors using probabilistic techniques.

**Use Cases:**
- Large-scale similarity search
- Real-time applications requiring low latency
- High-dimensional data where exact search is computationally expensive

**Trade-off:** Speed vs. accuracy - configurable precision levels.

### Range Search
Retrieve all vectors within a specified distance from a query vector.

**Use Cases:**
- Spatial queries
- Threshold-based filtering
- Outlier detection
- Geographic information systems

### Cosine Similarity Search
Identify vectors with the highest cosine similarity to the query vector.

**Use Cases:**
- Text similarity and document retrieval
- High-dimensional sparse data
- Recommendation systems
- Natural language processing

**Advantage:** Ideal for normalized data where magnitude is less important than direction.

## Algorithm Implementations

### 1. KD-Tree (K-Dimensional Tree)

**Best For:** Low to medium dimensional data (typically ≤ 20 dimensions)

**Characteristics:**
- Binary space partitioning tree
- Excellent performance for exact nearest neighbor search in low dimensions
- O(log N) average case, O(N) worst case
- Performance degrades significantly in high dimensions (curse of dimensionality)

**Implementation Details:**
```csharp
// Optimized for dimensions ≤ 20
// Automatically switches to linear search for high dimensions
// Thread-safe operations with read-write locks
```

### 2. Ball Tree

**Best For:** High-dimensional data and non-Euclidean distance metrics

**Characteristics:**
- Metric tree structure using hyperspheres
- Better performance than KD-Tree in high dimensions
- Works with any distance metric (not just Euclidean)
- O(log N) average complexity
- More robust to the curse of dimensionality

**Advantages:**
- Handles arbitrary distance functions
- Consistent performance across different dimensionalities
- Good for sparse and dense high-dimensional data

### 3. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

**Best For:** Large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search

**Characteristics:**
- Graph-based algorithm with hierarchical structure
- Excellent recall/performance trade-off
- Scalable to millions of vectors
- Configurable accuracy vs. speed parameters

**Key Features:**
- Multi-layer graph structure
- Efficient construction and search
- High recall rates with fast query times
- Memory efficient for large datasets

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `M`: Maximum connections per node
- `efConstruction`: Size of dynamic candidate list during construction
- `ef`: Size of dynamic candidate list during search

### 4. LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)

**Best For:** Approximate similarity search in very high dimensions

**Characteristics:**
- Hash-based probabilistic algorithm
- Sub-linear query time
- Particularly effective for binary and sparse data
- Tunable precision/recall trade-offs

**Use Cases:**
- Document similarity
- Image similarity

### 5. Linear Search

**Best For:** Small datasets, exact results, or as a baseline

**Characteristics:**
- Brute-force comparison with all vectors
- O(N) time complexity
- Guaranteed exact results
- Simple and reliable

**When to Use:**
- Datasets with < 1000 vectors
- When exact results are critical
- As a fallback or verification method
- Debugging and testing

### 6. Binary Quantization

**Best For:** Memory-constrained environments

**Characteristics:**
- Compresses vectors to binary representations
- Significant memory reduction (32x compression)
- Fast bitwise distance calculations
- Some accuracy loss for memory savings

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower memory usage
- Faster distance calculations
- Reduced precision
- Best for high-dimensional data

### 7. Product Quantization

**Best For:** Large-scale vector compression

**Characteristics:**
- Divides vectors into subspaces
- Quantizes each subspace independently
- Configurable compression ratios
- Better accuracy than binary quantization

**Benefits:**
- Reduced memory footprint
- Maintains reasonable accuracy
- Scalable to very large datasets
- Configurable quality/compression trade-off

## Distance Metrics

### Euclidean Distance (L2)
- Most common distance metric
- Measures straight-line distance
- Good for continuous, normalized data

### Cosine Similarity
- Measures angle between vectors
- Ideal for high-dimensional sparse data
- Commonly used in text processing

### Manhattan Distance (L1)
- Sum of absolute differences
- Robust to outliers
- Good for categorical data

### Chebyshev Distance (L∞)
- Maximum difference across dimensions
- Useful for specific applications
- Less sensitive to scale

### Minkowski Distance
- Generalized distance metric
- Parameterizable (includes L1, L2 as special cases)
- Flexible for different data types
